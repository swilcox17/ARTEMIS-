# ARTEMIS-
Partnering with a team of engineers, we are designing an aquadrone to collect trash. The idea is to ultimately be able to refine this product to where it could be mass produced cheaply and can then be controlled via mobile app, rewarding people in a game like ui for collecting trash and cleaning the waterways.
